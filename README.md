## Guide

This workshop aims to be an introduction to the Julia programming language.
Because of that, it covers a wide range of topics and ends up being a X hours
workshop, which might be too extensive in certain situations.

We suggest taking a look at our [recommended schedule](https://pumasai-labs.github.io/Julia-Workshop/#schedule)
on the homepage of the workshop for more information on how to divide the workshop.
You will notice that the workshop is divided in N parts, which is also
reflected in the way in which we have organized the code examples in this repository:

| Workshop section | Code folder |
|------------------|-------------|
| Variables and Types | `01-variables`|
| Functions | `03-functions` |
